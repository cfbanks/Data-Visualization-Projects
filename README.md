# Data-Visualization-Projects

This repository contains some of the data visualization projects that I completed during my Master of Data Science Degree at the University of British Columbia (Okanagan Campus). Our course focused on using the Altair (for Python) and GGplot2 (for R) visualization libraries. 

**Please Note: All of these projects were completed under time constraints (1-2 weeks) of a busy Masters program. Please consider that information when viewing the projects. I plan on improving these projects in the future when I have more free time.**

## Project #1: NBA analytics dashboard

This dashboard was created using Python, Plotly, Dash, and Heroku. It displays statistical information about basketball players in the NBA, and statistical trends found in the league as a whole. I worked as part of a group of four students, and I was primarily in charge of the data wrangling and visualizations used for the "NBA Trends" tab of the dashboard. I was also involved in creating identical charts for all the tabs for the R language version of the dashboard. Here is the link to the dashboard: [NBA analytics dashboard](https://nba-analytics-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Project #2: Business Report to a General Manager on the use of the NBA analytics dashboard 

This business proposal was written with an NBA general manager as the intended audience. The purpose of the proposal was to demonstrate the value of the NBA analytics dashboard mentioned above and convince the manager to use the dashboard in their organization.

## Project #3: NBA blog post for a general audience

The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate how the message of data can change when it is visualized in different ways. The blog was written with the general population as the intended audience. 

## Project #4 Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of NBA data set

This project was completed using the R language. I worked with a partner to complete this exploratory data analysis of the NBA data set used for projects 1-3. This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the data wrangling and EDA performed on this data set. 

## Project #5 Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of simulated health insurance data

This project was completed using the Python language. The EDA was completed with a partner and the result of our EDA is displayed in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Folder #6 Weekly data visualization assignments

This last folder contains the Jupyter notebooks of my weekly data visualization assignments. These assignments were completed independently in R and Python. The work consisted of duplicating and manipulating the screenshots of the plots created by the instructor by wrangling the data and plotting it in specific ways.
